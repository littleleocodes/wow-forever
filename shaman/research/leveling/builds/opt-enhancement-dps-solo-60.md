## Notes

- Report: shaman/research/talents/forever/optimizer/enhancement-dps-solo-60.md
- 2026-11-03 (repair_builds.py, client build 1.60.1.70753 trees): 12/31/8 -> 12/31/8; order dropped: a moved talent breaks it (order_repair.py) (refill: the enhancement-dps model, solo-60).

## Open questions (verify in the live game)

- Hand-entered effect values (see the manual effect file) are the weakest inputs — verify the ones this build leans on.
