*[Mage](../../README.md) · [Raids: training dummy, raid and parse](../README.md) · WoW: Forever — proposed*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Build** | 14/32/5 (Arcane / Fire / Frost) |
| **Role** | DPS — Raid |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Data** | WoW: Forever beta client build 1.60.1.70009 (2026-09-25 snapshot in `_reference/data/forever-talents/`) — **subject to change before launch** |

## Summary

Produced by the stats model (`_reference/data/scorer/`) for spec model `fire-raid` and profile `parse`: score +196.8% (DPS gain vs. no talents). Every number behind it is in the effect files (tooltip-parsed or hand-entered with its arithmetic); change those, not this build.

## Point allocation

| **Arcane Focus** | 4/5 | changed | Improves your chance to hit with Arcane spells by 4%. |
| **Arcane Concentration** | 5/5 | unchanged | Gives you a 10% chance of entering a Clearcasting state after any damage spell hits a target. The Clearcasting state reduces the mana cost of your next damage spell by 100%. |
| **Magic Absorption** | 2/2 | changed | Increases all your resistances by 10 and causes all spells you fully resist to restore 2% of your total mana. Cannot trigger more often than 1 time per sec. |

| **Improved Scorch** | 3/3 | changed | Your Scorch spell has a 100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Fire damage. This vulnerability increases all Fire damage you deal to your target by 3% and lasts 30 sec, stacking up to 5 times. |
| **Hot Streak** | 1/1 | **NEW** | Your non-periodic critical strikes with Fireball, Frostfire Bolt, Fire Blast, and Scorch grant Hot Streak for 20 sec. Hot Streak reduces the cast time of Pyroblast by 25%, stacking up to 3 times. |
| **Master of Elements** | 3/3 | changed | Your Fire and Frost critical strikes will refund 30% of their base mana cost. |
