## Leveling rotation

Not simulated in the fight lab; the class's leveling priority is on the [leveling rotation page](../rotation.md).

## Notes

- +4.0% faster than the hand draft leveling-frost, over the replacement bar: this build is the spec's leveling pick, the hand draft stays as the alternative.
- Race at levels 20-60 (seed 3, 3,000 fights per level; level-weighted seconds per kill, lower is faster): this build 30.24; leveling-frost 31.44, opt-frost-aoe-leveling-aoe 34.85. The search simulated 48,237 builds.
- Fight-lab numbers are a model of the beta (the assumptions in fightlab/tables.py), not in-game measurements.
- 2026-10-30 (repair_builds.py, client build 1.60.1.70707 trees): 18/3/30 -> 18/3/30; Arcane Focus 2 gone; Elemental Precision -> Precision (renamed); +1 Missile Barrage (tier gating for Arcane Meditation); +1 Missile Barrage (tier gating for Arcane Meditation); order dropped (order_repair.py) (refill: the frost-leveling model, leveling-st).
