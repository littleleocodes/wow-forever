|---|---|
| **Build** | 4/31/16 (Arcane / Fire / Frost) |
| **Role** | DPS — Raid |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Data** | WoW: Forever beta client build 1.60.1.70291 (2026-10-08 snapshot in `_reference/data/forever-talents/`) — **subject to change before launch** |

## Summary

The Frostfire build the machine-learning talent search found in a full raid (every raid buff and debuff: the group setting) on 2026-10-03 in the community simulator, in the spec's phase-1 BiS gear and the raid rotation of the entry frostfire-raid (raidsim/ml_talents.py: a random forest trained on simulated builds guides a genetic search over every legal build of the spec; the finalists are raced on fresh seeds and the winner is checked against all its one-move and prerequisite-chain neighbours).

## Point allocation

### Arcane (4)

| Talent | Pts | vs Classic | Effect at this rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Improved Channeling** | 4/5 | **NEW** | Gives you a 80% chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while channeling Arcane Missiles and a 56% chance while casting Arcane Blast. |

### Fire (31)

| Talent | Pts | vs Classic | Effect at this rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wake of Fire** | 1/2 | **NEW** | Reduces the cooldown of your Fire Blast spell by 1 sec. Killing a non-trivial target increases the critical strike chance of your next Fire Blast cast within 30 sec by 25%. |
| **Improved Fireball** | 4/5 | changed | Reduces the casting time of your Fireball and Frostfire Bolt spells by 0.4 sec. |
| **Ignite** | 5/5 | unchanged | Your critical strikes from Fire damage spells cause the target to burn for an additional 40% of your spell's damage over 4 sec. |
| **Flame Throwing** | 2/2 | unchanged | Increases the range of your Fire spells by 6 yards. |
| **Impact** | 1/3 | changed | Gives your Fire spells a 3% chance to stun the target for 2 sec. |

| **Pyroblast** | 1/1 | changed | Hurls an immense fiery boulder that causes 101 to 131 Fire damage and an additional 44 Fire damage over 12 sec. |
| **Improved Scorch** | 3/3 | changed | Your Scorch spell has a 100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Fire damage. This vulnerability increases all Fire damage you deal to your target by 3% and lasts 30 sec, stacking up to 5 times. |
| **Heating Up** | 1/1 | **NEW** | Non-periodic critical strikes with Fireball, Frostfire Bolt, Fire Blast, and Scorch reduce the cast time of your next Pyroblast cast within 20 sec by 25%, stacking up to 3 times. |
| **Critical Mass** | 3/3 | unchanged | Increases the critical strike chance of your Fire spells by 6%. |
| **Fire Power** | 5/5 | unchanged | Increases the damage done by your Fire spells by 10%. |
| **Combustion** | 1/1 | changed | When activated, this spell causes each of your Fire damage spell hits to increase your critical strike chance with Fire damage spells by 10%. This effect lasts until you have caused 3 non-periodic critical strikes with Fire spells. |

### Frost (16)

|---|---|---|---|
| **Elemental Precision** | 5/5 | changed | Improves your chance to hit with Frost and Fire spells by 5%. |

## Notes

- Against the best hand draft frostfire-raid in a full raid, same gear and fights (100,000, one seed): +1.6% (under the 2% bar: the hand draft stays the pick).
- Where the simulator measured no difference, the points follow frostfire-raid: Improved Fireball → Burning Soul, Flame Throwing → Burning Soul, Impact → Burning Soul, Frostbite → Improved Channeling, Ice Lance → Improved Channeling, Arctic Reach → Improved Channeling (the same DPS as the search winner 1/31/19 on one seed, 30,000 fights).
- Search result (full raid): 1/31/19 at 739.6 ± 0.23 DPS over 100,000 fights; runner-up 3/31/17 (+0.00%; the winner takes Flame Throwing 2, Frostbite 1, Ice Lance 1, Impact 3, Improved Channeling 1, Improved Flamestrike 1; the runner-up Blast Wave 1, Burning Soul 1, Improved Channeling 3, Improved Fire Ward 2, Improved Flamestrike 2); 1,942 builds simulated; certificate: none of its 311 one-move and chain-move neighbours was 0.1% ahead.
- Simulator numbers are the community's model of the beta (ElliotWood/Forever 40be98e with this project's patches), not in-game measurements; the talents are the simulator's answer for this gear and rotation.
- Pre-BiS gear: 3/31/17 at 721.6 DPS in a full raid (other talents: _reference/dps-rankings.md).
- Alone on the training dummy (only your own buffs) the search's best is 1/34/16 at 627.1 DPS.
- 2026-10-03 filler audit (raidsim/filler_audit.py, user question on zero-value fillers): points the simulator measures at 0 moved, one at a time, to talents that help in a real raid (interrupt protection, threat, mana, range, survival; the simulator cannot see these, so the order is our judgment) or that gain DPS: Impact -> Flame Throwing (range). Net +0.00% on a third seed.
- 2026-10-03: repaired for beta build 1.60.1.70170 (talents removed, renamed or moved): Hot Streak 1 out; Heating Up 1 in; to be re-optimized.
