**[Fury — Raid](../research/raid/builds/fury-open-raid.md)** (18/31/2) — [open the talent tree](https://talentsforever.com/warrior/60/04305013002-05053035102010501-2-6)

> 🔬 Derived build: found by this project's open talent search (every legal build, no tree rule, in the community's raid simulator in a full raid, raced against the rotation's builds); it beat the hand-made build (fury-dw-raid), which stays below as the alternative. A model of the beta, to check at launch.

**Other setups of this spec.** This build is the Dual-wield setup. The spec's best build for each other setup, in a full raid:

- Two-handed: [Fury (optimized, two-handed)](../research/raid/builds/opt-arms-2h-raid-raid-dps.md) (20/31/0), 898 DPS in a full raid — [open the talent tree](https://talentsforever.com/warrior/60/03305013032-05250030052210501--6)

## How to play

**Then press the first one that is ready**, top to bottom:

1. **Bloodthirst**
2. **Death Wish**: a big cooldown, save it for the last 45 seconds of the fight
3. **Whirlwind**
4. **Execute** when the target is below 20% health
5. **Hamstring**
6. **Bloodrage** when you have less than 23 rage
7. **Heroic Strike** when you have 68+ rage

Between these, your white swings do the rest.

**Advanced: your cooldowns and extras.** Once the list above feels easy, add these:

- **Recklessness**: once a fight, in the last 45 seconds of the fight
- Use your trinkets and a potion together with your big cooldowns.

*The simulator's full rotation for this build, with every condition: [research rotation page](../research/raid/rotation.md).*

## Why this rotation

Fury in a raid fights in **Berserker Stance** with a weapon in each hand: **Bloodthirst** and **Whirlwind** on cooldown, **Execute** in the gaps below 20%, **Hamstring** in the short gaps and **Heroic Strike** only when rage piles up. **Death Wish** and **Recklessness** wait for the last 45 seconds.

**Why it works**

- **Bloodthirst** (30 rage, 6-second cooldown) and **Whirlwind** (25 rage, 22 with **Raging Blows**, 10-second cooldown) are your main attacks: press them the moment they are ready. **Whirlwind** now always hits with both weapons, and it needs **Berserker Stance**, the stance this list never leaves.
- Below 20%, **Execute** still comes after **Bloodthirst** and **Whirlwind**. It spends all your rage (600 damage plus 15 per extra rage point; 10 rage to cast with **Improved Execute**), so it takes the global cooldowns between them; a full raid gives you enough rage that the simulator measured this order slightly better.
- **Death Wish** (+20% physical damage for 30 seconds, 3-minute cooldown) and **Recklessness** (+100% crit chance for 15 seconds) wait until about 45 seconds are left, so they cover the execute phase; the line above that says to use **Death Wish** at the start does not match the rotation. Crits give double rage in Forever, so the **Recklessness** window also feeds bigger **Execute** hits. The simulator measured 0.7% more damage with **Death Wish** at 45 seconds than at 30, and in fights longer than about 3.5 minutes it presses it at the pull as well.
- **Hamstring** (10 rage) fills a global cooldown only when **Bloodthirst** is more than a second away and **Whirlwind** more than 1.5 seconds: it is a cheap extra main-hand hit that can trigger on-hit effects such as a shaman's Windfury Totem, but it must never delay your main attacks. The simulator measured 1.9% more damage with this rule than with **Hamstring** only above 80 rage.
- **Heroic Strike** is a rage dump, not a filler: queue it only at 67 rage or more on a single target. It replaces a white swing, and white swings are your steady rage (each gives rage in proportion to your weapon's speed, double on a crit), so an early one starves **Bloodthirst** and **Whirlwind**; in Forever it also no longer helps your off-hand hit. The simulator measured 0.9% more damage at 67 rage than at 45.
- **Bloodrage** waits until you are under about 22 rage, so it refills an empty bar instead of topping up a full one. The simulator measured 1% more damage than pressing it whenever you are under 90.

**Caveats**

- The page's numbers assume a **Recklessness** in every fight and two Mighty Rage Potions (one early, one in the last 30 seconds). **Recklessness** has a 30-minute cooldown, so you will not have it on every boss: the simulator measured 11% more damage with it than without.
- With several targets, **Whirlwind** hits up to 4 of them, and above 40 rage **Cleave** replaces **Heroic Strike** (the full list does this).
- The simulator ignores threat. **Heroic Strike** causes a high amount of threat, so it is the first thing to stop if you pull aggro. **Death Wish** and **Recklessness** also make you take 5% and 20% more damage.
- Stand behind the boss: from the front it can parry and block, and a swing that does not land gives you no rage.

**When to change it**

- Alone or in a small group (fewer buffs, less rage), put **Execute** first below 20%, stack **Sunder Armor** to 5 yourself and skip **Hamstring**. That is the simulator's rotation for a warrior alone on a training dummy, where stacking **Sunder Armor** was worth 12%.
- If nobody in your group has **Battle Shout** up, keep it up yourself (3 minutes), and put one **Sunder Armor** on a boss that has none: the list leaves both out because the simulator's raid already had them.
- Before a boss's fear, press **Berserker Rage** (30-second cooldown, 10 seconds of fear immunity); **Death Wish** also makes you immune. The simulator's boss never fears, so the list leaves it out.
- With a two-hander (the page's two-handed option), drop **Heroic Strike** and cast **Hamstring** whenever nothing else is ready: in the simulator's two-handed raid rotation those two changes were worth 5.4% and 6.6%. That rotation also uses **Bloodrage** under 90 rage and puts **Whirlwind** before **Bloodthirst** when **Bloodthirst** is more than 1.5 seconds away.

## The numbers

| Setting | DPS |
|---|---|
| Full raid, 3-minute fight (every raid buff and debuff: what this page ranks on) | 925 |

**By gear tier** (the spec's best talents for each tier and setting in its own gear, found by this project's machine-learning search in the community simulator; [every spec](../../_reference/dps-rankings.md)):

| Gear | Full raid DPS | Best talents |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-BiS | 705 | [13/38/0](https://talentsforever.com/warrior/60/20305012-25050005152010501--6) |
| Phase 1 BiS | 723 | [13/38/0](https://talentsforever.com/warrior/60/20305012-25050005152010501--6) |

*Gear-tier numbers searched on 2026-10-02, on an older simulator build than the rest of this page (before beta 70291 and the 2026-10-09 audit that took Atiesh out of the full raid): they run 3-7% high and can order the specs differently than the full-raid ranking. The searches are queued to run again.*
